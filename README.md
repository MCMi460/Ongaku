# Ongaku
_You know, [ongaku](https://jisho.org/word/%E9%9F%B3%E6%A5%BD)._

A port of **[Ongaku](https://github.com/spotlightishere/Ongaku)** to Python. Why? I don't know.

A simple application providing the now playing state from iTunes (or the Music app) as RPC in Discord via [PyPresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence).

### Credits
[Spotlight](https://github.com/spotlightishere) for (unknowingly and unwillingly) letting me use their code as reference for this.
