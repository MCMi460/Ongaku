# ![icon](/images/AppIcon.iconset/icon_32x32.png?raw=true) Ongaku
_You know, [ongaku](https://jisho.org/word/%E9%9F%B3%E6%A5%BD)._

A port of **[Ongaku](https://github.com/spotlightishere/Ongaku)** to Python. Why? I don't know.

A simple application providing the now playing state from iTunes (or the Music app) as RPC in Discord via [PyPresence](https://github.com/qwertyquerty/pypresence).
